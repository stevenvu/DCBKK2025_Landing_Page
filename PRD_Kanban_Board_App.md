# Product Requirements Document: Kanban Board Web Application

## 1. Overview
- **Project Name:** FlowTrack Kanban Board
- **Stakeholders:** Product Management, Engineering, Design, Sales Enablement, Customer Success, QA
- **Objective:** Deliver a lightweight, responsive kanban-style project management web app with intuitive drag-and-drop task organization for small teams needing simple workflow visualization.

## 2. Background & Context
- Existing teams rely on spreadsheets or heavyweight tools that are over-featured and expensive.
- Opportunity to capture teams seeking a focused kanban experience that launches quickly, is easy to adopt, and integrates with core productivity tools.
- MVP is a web application optimized for desktop browsers with progressive enhancement for tablets.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics
- **Primary Goal:** Achieve 2,000 active boards and 10,000 active cards within the first quarter after launch.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Onboard a new user from signup to first board creation in under 2 minutes (p95).
  - Maintain drag-and-drop interactions with <100ms visual feedback and <250ms persistence latency.
  - Reach a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 40+ from beta users.
  - Retain 60% of activated users (created ≥1 board, ≥3 cards) after 30 days.

## 4. Target Users & Personas
1. **Startup Project Leads**
   - Need to monitor sprint progress without complex ceremonies.
   - Value transparency, lightweight reporting, and quick task updates.
2. **Marketing Coordinators**
   - Manage campaign workflows and asset approvals.
   - Require visual status tracking, collaboration with external contractors, and due dates.
3. **Freelance Collaborators**
   - Participate as guests on client boards.
   - Need a frictionless interface, limited access scopes, and mobile-friendly notifications.

## 5. Use Cases & User Stories
- As a project lead, I want to create boards with customizable columns so I can model different workflows.
- As a team member, I want to drag and drop cards between columns to update task status without opening modals.
- As a collaborator, I want to comment on cards and mention teammates to coordinate asynchronously.
- As a coordinator, I want to filter cards by assignee, label, or due date to focus on priorities.
- As an admin, I want to manage board-level permissions to control who can edit columns or cards.

## 6. Feature Scope
### 6.1 Must-Have (MVP)
- User authentication (email + password, with optional OAuth 2.0 providers scoped for future).
- Board creation, listing, and deletion for authenticated users.
- Configurable columns (create, rename, reorder, archive).
- Cards with title, description, assignee, labels, due date, and activity log.
- Real-time drag-and-drop interactions with auto persistence.
- Comments with @mentions and markdown-lite formatting (bold, italics, code, lists).
- Basic search and filtering by text, label, assignee, and due date.
- Responsive layout supporting desktop and tablet viewports.
- Audit log of card movements (surface in activity sidebar).
- Email notifications for mentions and due date reminders (daily digest).

### 6.2 Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
- Swimlanes per assignee or label.
- Public share links with read-only views.
- Integration webhooks (Slack, Teams) for card updates.
- Mobile-native apps leveraging the same backend.
- Analytics dashboard (lead time, throughput).

## 7. Functional Requirements
- **Drag & Drop:** Smooth, accessible drag-and-drop using HTML5 DnD or a library such as `react-beautiful-dnd`; keyboard accessible reordering.
- **Real-Time Sync:** Pessimistic UI updates with optimistic rendering; conflict resolution when multiple users move the same card.
- **Persistence:** RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints secured via JWT session tokens. Transactions ensure column order consistency.
- **Notifications:** Background job queue (e.g., BullMQ) to send email notifications via transactional email provider.
- **Search & Filter:** Server-side filtering endpoints with pagination; client caches filter state per board.
- **Audit Trail:** Card activity stream stored with timestamp, actor, action, payload.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** First meaningful paint <2s on broadband; drag interaction latency <100ms; API response times <300ms p95.
- **Availability:** 99.5% uptime target for production environment.
- **Security:** OWASP Top 10 mitigations, encrypted storage for secrets, rate limiting on auth endpoints.
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA; ensure keyboard support for all interactions including drag-and-drop alternative controls.
- **Scalability:** Support 50 concurrent active users per board and 5,000 cards per workspace.
- **Localization:** English-only at launch; content structured to enable localization later.

## 9. Technical Approach
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, Vite or Next.js for build; state management via Redux Toolkit or React Query; CSS-in-JS or Tailwind for theming.
- **Backend:** Node.js + NestJS/Express with PostgreSQL for relational data; Prisma ORM for schema management; Redis for caching and job queue.
- **Infrastructure:** Deploy on containerized environment (Docker + Kubernetes) or managed PaaS; CDN for static assets.
- **Drag-and-Drop Implementation:** Evaluate `react-beautiful-dnd` vs. `@dnd-kit/core`; ensure virtualization for large columns.
- **Testing:** Unit (Jest), integration (Playwright/Cypress for E2E), performance monitoring (Lighthouse CI, k6 load tests).

## 10. Data Model (High-Level)
- **User:** id, name, email, avatar, auth_provider, role, preferences.
- **Workspace:** id, name, owner_id, billing_plan.
- **Board:** id, workspace_id, name, description, column_order[], visibility.
- **Column:** id, board_id, name, position, wip_limit, archived_at.
- **Card:** id, column_id, title, description, position, assignee_id, due_date, labels[], checklist, archived_at.
- **Comment:** id, card_id, author_id, body, mentions[], created_at.
- **Activity:** id, entity_type, entity_id, actor_id, action, metadata, created_at.
- **Notification:** id, user_id, type, payload, status, scheduled_for.

## 11. UX & Design Requirements
- Kanban board layout with horizontal scroll for columns, vertical scroll for cards.
- Drag handle icons for cards and columns; visual feedback (shadow, lift) during drag.
- Color-coded labels with customizable names and hues.
- Card quick-view popover on click with essential metadata and inline editing.
- Dark mode support (post-MVP) but design tokens prepared at MVP for easy adoption.
- Empty states with guidance copy and quick actions.
- Toast notifications for successful saves and error states with retry.

## 12. Analytics & Instrumentation
- Track funnel events: signup → create board → add column → add card → drag card.
- Capture board usage metrics: number of cards per column, movement frequency, completed tasks.
- Log user engagement (session duration, return frequency) with privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA).
- Integrate with product analytics (e.g., PostHog, Amplitude).

## 13. Rollout Plan & Milestones
1. **Week 1-2:** Requirements validation, wireframes, architecture decisions, tech spike for drag-and-drop and real-time sync.
2. **Week 3-5:** Core feature development (auth, boards, columns, cards, DnD persistence).
3. **Week 6-7:** Collaboration features (comments, mentions, notifications), accessibility QA.
4. **Week 8:** Beta release to pilot customers, collect feedback.
5. **Week 9:** Performance tuning, analytics instrumentation, security review.
6. **Week 10:** Public launch with marketing campaign and onboarding guides.

## 14. Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Complex drag-and-drop interactions degrade performance on large boards.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement virtualization, throttle re-renders, load test high-card scenarios early.
- **Risk:** Real-time conflicts between multiple editors lead to data inconsistencies.
  - **Mitigation:** Apply optimistic UI with server reconciliation and notify users of conflicting updates.
- **Risk:** Onboarding friction reduces activation.
  - **Mitigation:** Provide guided tour, pre-built templates, and contextual tooltips.
- **Risk:** Email notifications marked as spam.
  - **Mitigation:** Use reputable sender domain, implement SPF/DKIM/DMARC, allow granular notification settings.

## 15. Open Questions
- Should we support guest access without full accounts in MVP?
- Is single sign-on (SSO) a requirement for enterprise prospects in roadmap?
- What pricing tiers and limitations (board count, storage) should apply post-MVP?
- Do we need export/import functionality at launch?

## 16. Approval
- **Decision Makers:** Head of Product, Engineering Director, Design Lead.
- **Sign-off Criteria:** Acceptance of feature scope, UX flows, and launch milestones.
