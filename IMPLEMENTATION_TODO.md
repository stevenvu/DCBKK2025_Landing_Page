# FlowTrack Kanban MVP Implementation To-Do

This roadmap organizes delivery into discrete, testable phases. Each phase lists the concrete steps required to reach the milestone and the checks that confirm completion.

## Phase 1 – Project Foundation
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 + TypeScript workspace and commit baseline scaffolding.
- [x] Configure linting, formatting, and TypeScript strictness aligned with team conventions.
- [x] Add CI pipeline scripts or documentation for local linting/build commands.

**Test/Verification**
- Execute `npm run lint` and ensure it passes without warnings.
- Execute `npm run build` to validate the project compiles.
  - _Status_: Command execution is blocked in this environment due to restricted npm registry access; run locally or in CI to verify.

## Phase 2 – Layout & Theming
- [ ] Implement global layout (app shell, header, board canvas) with responsive CSS grid/flex patterns.
- [ ] Define global styles, color tokens, and typography scale for consistent branding.
- [ ] Add accessibility baseline (semantic landmarks, focus states, ARIA labels where needed).

**Test/Verification**
- Run `npm run lint` to confirm UI additions comply with lint rules.
- Use browser devtools Lighthouse accessibility check or axe DevTools scan targeting layout landmarks.

## Phase 3 – Core Kanban Interactions
- [ ] Build reusable Board, Column, and Card components with placeholder data.
- [ ] Integrate `@dnd-kit` drag-and-drop for moving cards between columns.
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates and visual drag affordances (ghost, drop indicator).

**Test/Verification**
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` to ensure type safety and bundling succeed.
- Perform manual QA: drag cards across columns verifying state updates and no console errors.

## Phase 4 – State Management & Persistence
- [ ] Introduce centralized state (e.g., React context or Zustand) to manage boards/columns/cards.
- [ ] Persist board state locally (LocalStorage) or wire up API stubs for later backend integration.
- [ ] Add empty-state handling and optimistic error recovery flows.

**Test/Verification**
- Run automated unit tests covering reducer/store logic (e.g., via Vitest/Jest) and ensure `npm test` passes.
- Validate persistence by refreshing the browser and ensuring board state restores.

## Phase 5 – Collaboration & Quality Hardening
- [ ] Implement card detail panel with comments, assignees, and labels per PRD scope.
- [ ] Add filtering/search capabilities at board level.
- [ ] Instrument analytics/telemetry hooks for usage metrics and error tracking.
- [ ] Polish performance (lazy loading, memoization) and finalize responsive breakpoints.

**Test/Verification**
- Extend unit/integration tests to cover collaboration features and filtering logic; confirm `npm test` stays green.
- Run targeted usability testing checklist (keyboard navigation, screen reader labels) and document findings.
- Execute `npm run build` and analyze bundle size/performance warnings.

## Phase 6 – Launch Readiness
- [ ] Draft release notes, onboarding docs, and support runbooks.
- [ ] Configure deployment pipeline (e.g., Vercel project) with environment variables.
- [ ] Conduct end-to-end smoke test on staging environment.

**Test/Verification**
- Verify CI/CD pipeline completes lint/build/deploy without failures.
- Run scripted smoke tests (Playwright/Cypress) on staging; capture results in QA log.
- Hold go/no-go review referencing metrics from previous phases.
